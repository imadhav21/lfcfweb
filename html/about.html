        Little Flock is not affiliated to any denomination. Our desire and prayer is that the Lord will continue to lead and
        enable us to abide under the authority of the Holy Scriptures. Believers from different cultures and nationalities come
        together to worship, fellowship, and serve the Lord (Acts 2: 41-47; Rev. 5:9).
        On the first day of every week, Little Flock assembles to break bread after a time of corporate and individual worship,
        praise, and thanksgiving. All those who have accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior, and have a clear
        conscience before God and man are welcome to take part in the Lord’s Table (Acts 11:28). A message from the Word of God
        follows.
        
        <br><br>
        You are welcome: If you are a born again believer in the Lord Jesus Christ, you are welcome to join us. Our desire is
        that we may be edified together by our mutual faith (Rom.1:12). If you are a seeker of Truth, you are also welcome to
        our meetings. As the Lord gives grace, we are here to welcome you with love and respect. Our brothers and sisters in
        Little Flock consider it a privilege to pray for those who are facing problems in any area of their lives. So, please do
        not hesitate to contact us or to come to us if you desire our prayer support.
        Weekly meetings are announced at the end of each Sunday service and also through this website. Emails are also sent to
        people who have given us their email IDs.

                    It was in the Fall of 1987 that a brother, in obedience to the call of the Lord, started this work together with his
                    wife and their three children. The work began in a small way in their home in East Lansing, Michigan. It started as a
                    Children’s ministry and grew to be a Bible Study group and then into a Church, named later as Little Flock Christian
                    Fellowship. The name was prompted by a letter from a brother in India who quoted Luke 12:32 to encourage the group.
                    Those who are familiar with the ministry of Brother Watchman Nee (1903-1972) whom God used mightily in China, might
                    wonder if we are connected to the Little Flock Assemblies he had started in China. We greatly appreciate Brother Nee’s
                    ministry but have no direct relation to his work. The brother and his wife whom God used to start this ministry along
                    with their children, had several years of close fellowship with Brother Bakht Singh (1903-2000) and his ministry in
                    India. God used Bakht Singh, both in India and in many other countries for salvation of souls and establishment of a few
                    thousands of churches which, as many have observed, are very close to the early church in terms of their understanding
                    and following the teachings of the Apostles.
                    <br><br>
                    For a few years, the Little Flock met in the home of the family that God used as an instrument to start this ministry.
                    In the days of the early Apostles there were many house churches (Col. 4:15; Rom. 16:5; Phil. 1:2). Even today there are
                    many house churches all over the world. As the number of believers increased, in the year 1995 the Little Flock’s Sunday
                    services were moved to the conference hall of a hotel in East Lansing. After the hotel was closed due to a serious fire
                    accident in 2004, the services were held in the community halls of the Michigan State University. By God’s grace we now
                    have the Michigan State University Alumni Chapel for our Sunday services. Weekly Bible studies and prayer meetings are
                    held in the home of the pastor.
                        <br><br>
                    As time passed, some of the fellow believers moved to other cities, where we began to visit them for the purpose of
                    praying and studying the Word with them. In 1997, the Lord led us to start monthly Bible Studies in the city of
                    Farmington Hills, near Detroit. The grace of God was upon this ministry. The Lord blessed these meetings for the
                    edification of many believers in that area. After waiting on the Lord for more than one year and believing that it was
                    God’s will, on June 6, 1999 –The Lord’s Day – the believers of that area gathered together for their first worship
                    service which included ‘breaking of bread’. That was the beginning of the church in the Detroit area. We now meet in a
                    hall rented from the Presbyterian church of Farmington Hills. These days, believers from different cities in the Detroit
                    area partake in these meetings. Praise the Lord!

                    <br><br>
                    For about three years starting in 1999, some of us periodically visited a sister who had moved to Mississauga, Ontario,
                    Canada. In the year 2000, a few more believers moved into this area from India, and they began to call us to visit them
                    and to hold prayer meetings and Bible studies for them, as and when possible. In response to this Macedonian call (Acts
                    16:9), the Lord enabled us to visit them once a month. As we continued those meetings, the Lord gave us a growing burden
                    for this area and we began to pray earnestly seeking the Lord’s guidance for further ministry over there.
                    <br><br>
                    On February 21, 2003, we had an all-night prayer meeting in Brampton, Ontario, Canada. This was attended by several
                    believers both from the Michigan and Toronto regions. The next day, being Saturday, some of the believers continued to
                    wait on the Lord seeking His guidance. Believing that it was God’s will, on February 23 – The Lord’s Day we had our
                    first worship service at Brampton, a city near Toronto, Ontario. Presently, the believers here are immigrants from other
                    countries, which reminds us of the church at Antioch (Acts 11:19-24). They have taken the name Antioch Christian
                    Fellowship for their assembly. They presently meet for worship services on Sundays in a conference hall at the Marriott
                    Hotel, Mississauga, and for prayer at homes of believers.
                    <br><br>
                    Thus, we were led step by step by the skillfulness of His loving hands to move on with the work of the Lord. We had no
                    plans of our own for these areas. It has always been our desire that we should not do God’s work in our own way or for
                    our own satisfaction. We desire to be led by the Lord.
                    <br><br>
                    Little Flock has not been free from attacks of the enemy (Eph. 6:12). Apostle Paul says: A great and effectual door is
                    opened for me, and there are many adversaries (I Cor. 16:9). The enemy at various times tried to disturb the work by his
                    subtle means, but the Lord gave us victory. We are aware that we are called to be His coworkers and laborers together
                    with Him (I Cor. 3:9; II Cor. 6:1); it is the Lord who is building His church (Matt. 16: 18). The battle is the Lord’s
                    (II Chro. 20:15).
                    <br><br>
                    As of now, the Little Flock does not own any building. We are indeed like strangers and pilgrims (Heb. 11:13). We know
                    that the Lord does not live in buildings made by hands (II Chro.2:6; 6:17). Once walking through a corn field, the Lord
                    said: Here is one who is greater than the temple (Matt. 12:6). The Lord dwells in the midst of His people (Rev. 1:13;
                    Matt. 18:20). We are satisfied with what the Lord has given to us for now. If it pleases Him, He will surely give us
                    buildings for His work, in His own time.
                    <br><br>
                    Please pray for us.
