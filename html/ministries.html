                    </ul>
                   
                    We recognize Sunday, the first day of the week, as the Lord’s Day (Mark 16:1-6; John 20:19; Rev. 1:10; Acts 20:7).
                    (Psalm 27:4).
                    <br><br>
                    On the Lord’s Day we gather together as His people, to worship the Lord remembering His great love and the redemptive
                    work done for us on the cross of Calvary. We sing hymns and choruses, meditate on God’s Word, and take part in His Table
                    (Communion) as commanded by the Lord and taught by the early apostles (Ps. 24:7; Luke 22:19-20; Acts 2:42, Acts 20:7; I
                    Cor. 11:23-31). Believers are given the privilege of individually praising and thanking the Lord before partaking in the
                    Lord’s Table (Psalm 22:2; Ps. 116:13,14; Ps. 40:3). Thus, instead of the pastor alone giving thanks for the Bread and
                    the Cup, the participating believers are also given the privilege of offering their thanksgiving to the Lord who gave
                    His body to be broken for them, and shed His blood for the remission of their sins. This is a wonderful experience for
                    God’s people at the Table of the Lord on every Lord’s Day (Acts 20:7). A message of teaching and instruction from the
                    Word of God follows.
                    <br><br>
                    After the service, those who can stay back participate in a fellowship-meal. We believe the church is the Household of
                    God (Ephesians 2:19). And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached
                    unto them (Acts 20:7).

                    D.L. Moody rightly said, “It is foolish and wicked to try to do God’s work without God’s power. But, there is no way for
                    Christians to have God’s power except by prayer”. It can be said that prayer meetings are the backbone of the church.
                    The last message of the Lord to his disciples was: Watch and pray (Matt. 26:41). We believe, a Christian is to pray
                    literally about everything (John R. Rice) and that a life of prayer is necessary for understanding heavenly things
                    (Bakht Singh). We meet for prayer once a week. In our prayer meetings we bring our needs and problems to the Lord and
                    seek His guidance for the ministry.

                    We believe, it is extremely important for the church and the parents to take care of the spiritual needs of the
                    children. If the Lord tarries, they are the ones who shall be Witnesses and Ministers in the next generation. Parents
                    are exhorted to pray much for their children and teach them God’s Word. Sunday school is not a substitute for what the
                    parents should be teaching their children. 
                    <br><br>
                    On Sundays, children are taught the Word of God in separate rooms during our Worship Services. All the teachers, who are born-again and baptized, periodically meet for prayer and consultation.

                    Occasionally, on Saturdays, we have youth meetings where the youth come together to hear about God's word, in addition to partaking in activities. Anyone can join from 13-30 years old. If you are intrested in joining these meetings contact [] for more information.

                    In addition, in August, we have a Youth Camp, where youth from 13-30 years old are invited to participate in the youth camp. In the youth camp, the youth learn more about the Word of God, as well as partake in many fun games and activities.
                    The youth are put into teams, and through the duration of the camp, have to compete with the other teams through different games and activities to win, such as volleyball, memorizing Bible verses, charades, acting out a skit, and much more. There are also non-team activites, such as basketball, kayaking, and more.
                    The Youth Camp runs four days, from Wednesday to Saturday. It is an overnight camp, where the youth will arrive on Wednesday afternoon and stay until Saturday afternoon. 
                    On Saturday, all parents are invited to come for a potluck lunch.
                    <br><br>
                    The camp is held at Faholo Conference Center in Grass Lake, MI. The camp is free to attend. More information will be posted as the date of the youth camp approaches. if you are intrested in attending contact [] for more information.

                    In Late August, we gather together for a Prayer Summit, where we focus primarily on prayer, and praying for the ministry and for others. 
                    We believe that the power of the church lies through prayer, and that prayer is very essential and crucial, especially during these times.
