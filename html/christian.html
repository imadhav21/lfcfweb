        <h2><b>Why should any one become a Christian?</b></h2>
        <br>
        For the answer, let us turn to the Bible, The Word of God:
        <br><br>
        God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of
        God, does not have life – I John 5:11, 12.
        <br><br>
        He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed
        in the name of the only begotten Son of God – John 3:18.
        <br><br>
        From these Scriptures it is very clear that if you do not have Christ in you, you stand condemned by God. The
        condemnation is the everlasting judgment of God. This is also called: Hell, which God has prepared for the Devil and his
        angels (Matt. 25:41). One you get into hell, you can never get out of it; it for ever and ever (Mark 9:48). Therefore,
        it is extremely important for you to get out of this condemnation without any delay.
        <br><br>
        On the other hand, God has made a wonderful way for you not only to escape hell, but also to live with Him for eternity
        and to inherit all that He has prepared for His people (Heb. 10:34; I Peter 1:4). That’s why the salvation that Christ
        gives us is called: Great Salvation (Heb. 2:3)
        <br><br><br>
        <h2><b>How to become a Christian?</b></h2>
        <br>
        First, you should know that becoming a Christian is not just a change of religion or moving one social system or culture
        to another. It is becoming a new creation in the Lord Jesus Christ – it is passing from eternal death into eternal life
        – it is passing from darkness into the marvelous light of Christ.
        <br><br>
        It is certain, no one can make you a Christian – no, not your good works – not even a priest or a church. It is the work
        of the Holy Spirit (I John 1:13). Read this message with an open mind and heart, and obey the Lord as He speaks to you.
        <br><br>
        <b><h5 class = "d-inline">First,</h5></b>    you should know that all are sinners (Rom. 3:23) – in the sight of God, all are spiritually dead (Eph. 2:1); all
        are in spiritual darkness (2 Cor. 4:4); and all are condemned to eternal judgment of God– to hell (John 3:18). 
        <br><br>
        <b><h5 class="d-inline">Second,</h5></b>, you should note that the loving God has made a provision for sinners to be saved from this condemnation. This provision
        of God is clearly declared in the Bible: For God so loved the world, that he gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever
        believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Christ came down from his glory in heaven, in the form of
        a man, humbled Himself, and laid down his life on the cross (Phi. 2:6-8). In Him was no sin, but in His body He bore all
        our sins and died on the cross for us. Another great truth is that Christ rose again from the grave triumphantly. Bible
        says, Christ died for our sins and rose again for our justification (Rom. 4:25).
        <br><br>
        <b><h5 class="d-inline">Third,</h5></b>
        acknowledge your sin before God and with true repentance, ask Him to forgive you. Your sins will be forgiven
        and the blood of Lord Jesus Christ will cleanse you from all sin (I John 1:9), and the Holy Spirit will come into your
        heart as promised in the Bible (John 7:39; 14:17; I Cor. 3:16; Acts 2:38). You are then a new creation in Christ Jesus
        (I1 Cor. 5:17), and as you walk with the Lord, He will give you victory over sin (I John 4:4). According to the Word of
        God, you are then born again (John 3:3-6; I peter 1: 23); you are saved; you are a child of God (John 1:12); you are a
        new creation in Christ (2 Cor. 5:17); and you are a Christian (Acts 11:26). You will have all this by the grace of God
        and not of yourself, for by grace a man/woman can be saved by faith in Lord Jesus Christ (Rom. 2:8).
        <br><br>
        <b><h5 class="d-inline">Fourth,</h5></b> after receiving this experience, you should obey God’s word about Baptism which is an ordinance of God. Bible
        says: Repent and be baptized (Acts 2:38). It is an external testimony of what has happened to you internally. In
        Baptism, you will be saying, Christ died for me and the old person inside me is dead with Him; Christ was buried and all
        my sins are buried with Him and are gone; and that Christ rose again with a new body, and I have His life in me and one
        day I will also be like Him and will live with Him (I John 3:2). To know more about Baptism, please read: Matthew
        3:13-15; Romans 6:3-11; Gal. 3:27; I Cor. 15:49-57; Acts 8:26-39; John 14:1-3.
        <br><br>
        <b><h5 class="d-inline">Finally,</h5></b> as a new believer in the Lord Jesus Christ, you should seek fellowship with others who have a similar
        experience. Bible tells us that the early believers in the days of the Apostles of Christ, lived in regular fellowship
        with one another, prayed and worshiped the Lord together, and broke bread as commanded by the Lord in Luke 22:19; Acts
        11:23-31. As you walk in obedience to the Word of God and remain in fellowship with other believers (church), you will
        be able to learn more about the truths that God would like you to know, and will be able to live a fruitful life in
        Christ, with the Joy and peace of God abiding in you. You will then be a blessing to others.
        <br><br>
        We pray and trust that God will speak to you as you read this short message about God’s way for man’s salvation.
